# Who am I?
  👋 Hi, I’m **TheJades**, or the **former joshuadragon77**.
# What am I interested in?
  👀 I’m interested in music, the theory, philosophy and the nature of the world (how the universe was born) and you!
# What music I like!
  🎶 I like music. I won't tell you as I am afraid to tell you all. But I can tell you that I like them. 
# What I'm learning.
  🌱 I’m currently learning engineering courses in university.
  <br>
  ✍️ I'm also learning how to be better at making visual art. I don't like being the person that is great with understanding computers, masterful at debugging, and idk what else. I want to expand and infilitrate a new world.

  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, yet so far. But, I am getting there.
